##### Cesar Cano de Oliveira

Televisioner is an app that lists series and episodes information, allowing you to search by name and manage a favorites list.

The universal apk is located at the .distribution folder, located at the root of the project.

## Implemented features
I will briefly comment on and describe my thought process while implementing each of one of them.
### Mandatory features
**- List all of the series contained in the API used by the paging scheme provided by the
API.**

I wanted to use the new Paging 3 lib but I thought a simpler in-house approach would be ok for this case.

**- Allow users to search series by name.**

I had some doubts about the best way and how this search should work. I started implementing just a filter on the series that were already loaded but then I implemented the Tv Maze search endpoint and decided to show a popup view with a list of the results, separated from the 'feed' paginated list.

**- The listing and search views must show at least the name and poster image of the
series.**

The posters size difference in some series was a cumbersome issue, proper resize/working alongside the designers would make for a better UI/solution.

**- After clicking on a series, the application should show the details of the series, showing
the following information:
    - Name
    - Poster
    - Days and time during which the series airs
    - Genres
    - Summary
    - List of episodes separated by season**
    
I wanted to make a better UI for this, but went for a simple but working one.

**- After clicking on an episode, the application should show the episodeâ€™s information, including:
    - Name
    - Number
    - Season
    - Summary
    - Image, if there is one**
    
   
No comments on this one :)

### Bonus feature implemented

##### Allow the user to save a series as a favorite.
The user can save a series as favorite by tapping the star button inside the series details screen
#### Allow the user to delete a series from the favorites list.
The user can remove the series from their favorite list by tapping the star button again, 'toggling the star off'
#### Allow the user to browse their favorite series in alphabetical order, and click on one to see its details.
The user can navigate to the favorite series tab in the bottom navigation bar and check their favorite series in alphabetical order, if any series is tapped, the user is taken to its detail page

#### Observations
I thought the favorite series 'package' would be a good feature to implement, since I could use Room as a local persistence database in order to simplify how the series are stored, avoiding complicated combinations of saving ids/multiple requests to the API

I wanted to implement the PIN/biometrics authentication feature as well but I didn't have the time :(

#### Architecture

I've decided to use MVVM with LiveData and sealed classes for the UI states.

I've also chose to implement a somewhat clean architecture, even though I didn't defined a lot of interfaces, because it was probably overengineering for this kind of project, since it almost have no business rules between the layers, but you can see that it made it a lot easier to test and to deal with errors in the most suitable place (for example, dealing with http errors in the datasource). It also helped converting from the Dao 'FavoriteSeries' model to the Domain Series model between the datasource and all the other layers, this way only FavoriteSeriesDataSource needs to know convert FavoriteSeries to Series, but I could use an Adapter between those two as well.

I didn't went full clean architecture because I think most of the times it is easy to overengineer when using this approach, I think it is about the balance between separating your layers properly and understanding the pros and cons of how much are you layering and abstracting.

#### UI
##### Improvements
If I had more time I would work to better preserve state while user navigates between the tabs and screens of the app. I'm not satisfied with the loading time and I'd probably try some caching for the retrofit calls to further optimize the UX. The search bar was not my favorite part but I thought it was good to implement for showing some different types of views. I really enjoyed doing the series details screen and favorite button/list, I think it turned out really good.

#### Tests
I didn't have the time for implementing some unit tests, I started them with little time left but had some minor issues with coroutines and live data testing boilerplate/setup, but I'm pretty sure injecting the dispatchers and having the dependency injection working as it is as well as the codebase was layered, the tests would be really nice to implement :)

#### Other

##### Git/CI
Since I was working by myself and I didn't have much time, I started the repository but didn't follow good commit/PR practices, but I enjoy having small-medium PRs with context and commits following the Karma commit style (http://karma-runner.github.io/6.3/dev/git-commit-msg.html) or similar, with a trunk based development even though I have no problems with git flow. I've used GitHub private repo and and for the CI I've decided to use Bitrise just to demonstrante a simple continuous integration pipeline with a trigger for PRs merging into main where the app is built and the linter and unit tests run. I've also configured a git hook for the repo to avoid commits that do not follow the style.

#### Libs used
Just in case you guys need a faster version of the technologies/dependencies and libs that I've used:
- Jetpack Navigation to coordinate tabs and screens
- LiveData to save data in ViewModels
- Room for persisting the favorite series data
- Retrofit for Http requests to the Tv Maze Api
- Coroutines for async calls
- Hilt for dependency injection
- Picasso for image loading and automatic cache
